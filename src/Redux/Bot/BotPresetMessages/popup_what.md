Popups open in small windows that open when an extension is triggered, usually from it's icon in the browsers toolbar. They can be used to display notifications, offer additional features and options, or display content from the extension. Popups are just HTML pages, so they mix HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create an interface you can interact with.
