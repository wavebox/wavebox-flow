/*
Styles let you change the way a page looks.
This template doesn't make any changes by default, so you need to un-comment
some of the examples, or write your own
*/

/*
For example you could make some pages look really great with a blanket
approach to setting colors...
*/
body {
  /* background: lightblue; */
  /* color: orangered; */

  /*
  New rules can sometimes conflict with those already on the page, so you may
  need to add an !important flag to the rule to really change the color...
  */
  /* background: lightblue !important; */
}

/*
The above made a change to the main element on the page, called the body, but
you probably want to be a bit more specific. You can use selectors to do this,
everything on a page is selectable with a selector. You could for example
pick...
  - a type of element (body, div, p)
  - an element with a specific class (.section)
  - an element with a unique id (#root)
...Here's an example rule that changes any elements with the "section" class...
*/
.section {
  /* border: 1px solid red */
}

/*
You can use the element inspector in the browsers developer tools to find out
more about a specific element and tailor a rule to it. There are some excellent
resources on how to get started with CSS here

/*
Most importantly, have fun!
